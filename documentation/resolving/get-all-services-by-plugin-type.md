Please see <[linkto:the-container/working-with-enumerable-types]> for a lot more information about what's going on behind the
scenes.

Once in a while you might want to get an enumerable of all the configured objects for a PluginType.  That's done with the `GetAllInstances()` method shown below:

<[sample:get-all-instances]>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><code>GetAllInstances()</code> respects the order in which the actual instances are configured in the Container.  Be warned that some other IoC tools make different assuptions if you are coming from a different tool.</div>
